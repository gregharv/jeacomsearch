Process Outline: Website and Document Crawling for RAG Embeddings
This document outlines the process for systematically crawling websites and processing other documents (like PDFs) to build a knowledge base in an SQLite database. This database will then serve as the source for generating vector embeddings for a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

1. Core Components and Technologies
Crawler/Scraper: A script or application (e.g., Python with libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) to fetch and parse web content.

PDF Processor: A library to extract text from PDF documents (e.g., Python with PyPDF2, pdfplumber).

SQLite Database: A lightweight, file-based database for storing crawled data.

Scheduler: A mechanism to trigger crawling and refresh processes (e.g., cron jobs, Python's schedule library).

Vector Embedding Generator: A separate process/script that reads from the SQLite DB and generates embeddings (e.g., using sentence transformers, OpenAI embeddings API). (This part is subsequent to the scope of this document but is the end goal).

2. Database Schema Design (SQLite)
We'll need a few tables to manage the data effectively.

Table: sources

id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT): Unique identifier for each source.

source_type (TEXT): Type of the source (e.g., 'website', 'pdf', 'docx').

base_url (TEXT, NULLABLE): The initial URL for a website crawl.

file_path (TEXT, NULLABLE): Path to the local file for documents like PDFs.

last_crawled_start_time (DATETIME, NULLABLE): When the last crawl/processing for this entire source started.

last_crawled_finish_time (DATETIME, NULLABLE): When the last crawl/processing for this entire source finished.

status (TEXT): Current status (e.g., 'pending', 'crawling', 'completed', 'error').

metadata_json (TEXT, NULLABLE): JSON string for any additional source-specific metadata.

Table: documents

id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT): Unique identifier for each individual document/page.

source_id (INTEGER): Foreign key referencing sources.id.

url (TEXT, UNIQUE): The specific URL of the web page or a unique identifier for a file document.

content_hash (TEXT): MD5 or SHA256 hash of the raw content to detect changes.

extracted_text (TEXT): The main textual content extracted from the page/document.

title (TEXT, NULLABLE): Title of the page/document.

first_crawled_date (DATETIME): When this specific document was first discovered and processed.

last_crawled_date (DATETIME): When this specific document was last successfully crawled/processed.

last_modified_date_on_source (DATETIME, NULLABLE): HTTP Last-Modified header or file system modification date, if available.

http_status_code (INTEGER, NULLABLE): HTTP status code from the last crawl attempt (for URLs).

metadata_json (TEXT, NULLABLE): JSON string for page-specific metadata (e.g., headers, links found).

processing_status (TEXT): (e.g., 'pending_embedding', 'embedded', 'error_extracting_text').

Table: crawl_log (Optional, for detailed logging)

id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT)

source_id (INTEGER, NULLABLE): Foreign key referencing sources.id.

document_id (INTEGER, NULLABLE): Foreign key referencing documents.id.

timestamp (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)

event_type (TEXT): (e.g., 'crawl_started', 'url_fetched', 'pdf_processed', 'error_occurred')

message (TEXT)

details_json (TEXT, NULLABLE)

3. Website Crawling Process
3.1. Initialization
Add Base URL: Add the website's base URL to the sources table with source_type = 'website'.

Queue Initial URL: Add the base URL to a crawling queue (can be in-memory for simple crawlers or a dedicated queue table/service for robust ones).

3.2. Crawling Cycle
For each URL in the queue:

Check robots.txt:

Fetch and parse robots.txt for the domain.

Respect disallow rules and crawl delays.

Check Database:

Has this URL been crawled recently? (Compare with last_crawled_date in documents).

If a refresh isn't due (see Section 5), skip or deprioritize.

Fetch Content:

Make an HTTP GET request.

Implement politeness: respect Crawl-Delay from robots.txt, add delays between requests.

Handle HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx). Store error codes in documents.http_status_code.

Store Last-Modified header if present.

Content Processing:

If successful (2xx status):

Calculate content_hash of the raw HTML.

Compare with existing content_hash in documents for this URL (if it exists). If unchanged and text already extracted, potentially skip deep processing.

Extract main textual content (e.g., using BeautifulSoup to get text from relevant tags like <article>, <main>, <p>, etc., avoiding boilerplate like navs, footers).

Extract the page title.

Discover new internal links:

Parse HTML for <a> tags.

Resolve relative URLs to absolute URLs.

Filter out external links, mailto links, etc.

For each new, valid internal URL: add it to the crawling queue if not already processed or queued.

Database Update:

New URL: Insert a new record into documents.

source_id, url, content_hash, extracted_text, title, first_crawled_date (now), last_crawled_date (now), http_status_code.

Existing URL: Update the record in documents.

Update content_hash, extracted_text (if changed), title, last_crawled_date (now), http_status_code.

Loop: Continue until the queue is empty.

Update sources table: Mark last_crawled_finish_time and update status.

3.3. Considerations
Scope: Define rules to stay within the target website (e.g., only crawl subdomains of the base URL).

Duplicate Content: Content hashing helps identify exact duplicates. Canonical URLs (<link rel="canonical">) can also guide this.

JavaScript-Rendered Content: If the site relies heavily on JS, a simple requests call won't get the full content. Consider tools like Selenium or Puppeteer (or Scrapy with Splash). This adds complexity.

Rate Limiting: Be respectful. Implement configurable delays. User-Agent string should be set.

Error Handling: Robustly handle network issues, timeouts, malformed HTML. Log errors.

Session Management: For sites requiring login (generally harder and may require specific configurations).

4. PDF (and Other Document) Processing
4.1. Initialization
Identify PDFs:

From Website Crawl: If the crawler encounters links to PDFs, download them.

Manual Addition: Provide a directory of PDFs or individual file paths.

Add to sources or documents:

If adding a batch of PDFs from a specific source (e.g., "Company X Reports"), create an entry in sources with source_type = 'pdf_batch' (or similar) and file_path pointing to the directory.

Each PDF will then become an entry in the documents table.

Alternatively, if PDFs are ad-hoc, each can be directly referenced in documents with a source_id pointing to a generic "Local Files" source or the website source it was found on.

4.2. Processing Cycle
For each PDF file:

Check Database:

Use file_path (or a generated unique ID for the PDF) as the url in the documents table.

Check last_crawled_date and content_hash (hash of the PDF file itself).

Extract Text:

Use a PDF library (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfplumber) to extract all text.

Handle potential extraction errors (e.g., scanned PDFs without OCR, password-protected PDFs).

Content Hashing:

Calculate a hash of the raw PDF file content to detect if the file itself has changed.

Optionally, also hash the extracted text if pre-processing/cleaning is done.

Database Update:

New PDF: Insert into documents: source_id, url (file path or unique ID), content_hash (of file), extracted_text, title (if extractable from metadata), first_crawled_date, last_crawled_date.

Existing PDF (Changed): Update documents: content_hash, extracted_text, last_crawled_date.

Existing PDF (Unchanged): Update last_crawled_date.

4.3. Considerations
OCR for Scanned PDFs: If scanned image-based PDFs are common, integrate an OCR tool (e.g., Tesseract via pytesseract). This significantly increases processing time and complexity.

Large Files: Handle memory efficiently.

Other Formats: Similar logic can be applied for .docx (using python-docx), .txt, etc. The source_type field helps manage different parsers.

5. Refresh Crawling / Processing
5.1. Strategy
Full Re-crawl: Periodically re-crawl the entire website from the base URL. Simpler to implement but can be inefficient.

Incremental Re-crawl:

Prioritize URLs based on last_crawled_date.

Check Last-Modified HTTP headers or file modification timestamps. If the server/file indicates no change, you might skip re-downloading/re-processing.

Always re-calculate content_hash on fetched/read content to confirm.

Sitemap Check: If a sitemap.xml is available, parse it. It often includes <lastmod> tags, which can guide refresh priorities.

5.2. Triggering
Scheduled Jobs: Use cron or a Python scheduler to:

Iterate through sources and trigger crawls for those due for a refresh (e.g., last_crawled_finish_time is older than X days).

Iterate through documents and re-check individual items that haven't been checked in a while or for which Last-Modified hints at a change.

5.3. Updating Records
Always update last_crawled_date in the documents table upon successful re-processing.

If content has changed (new content_hash), update extracted_text.

Log changes or significant events.

6. Preparing for Vector Embeddings
Text Source: The extracted_text column in the documents table is the primary source for embeddings.

Chunking Strategy: Before generating embeddings, text often needs to be chunked into smaller, manageable segments (e.g., paragraphs, sentences, or fixed-size overlapping chunks). This chunking logic is part of the embedding generation pipeline, not the crawling/storage itself, but the quality of extracted_text is crucial.

Metadata for RAG: The documents table (with its url, title, source_id, last_crawled_date) provides crucial metadata that should be stored alongside or referenced by the vector embeddings. This allows the RAG system to cite sources and provide context.

Identifying New/Updated Content: The processing_status field in documents can be set to 'pending_embedding' when new content is added or existing content is updated. The embedding generation process would query for these records.

7. Workflow Summary
Define Sources: Add website base URLs or file paths/directories to the sources table.

Initial Crawl/Process:

For websites: Start with base URL, fetch, parse, extract text & links, store in documents, add new links to queue.

For files: Read file, extract text, store in documents.

Scheduled Refresh:

Periodically trigger re-crawling/re-processing of sources or individual documents.

Check for changes using content hashes and/or last modified dates.

Update documents with new content and timestamps.

Embedding Generation (Separate Process):

Query documents for new or updated extracted_text.

Chunk text.

Generate embeddings.

Store embeddings with references back to documents.id.

Update processing_status in documents.

This outline provides a comprehensive framework. The specific implementation details will vary based on the chosen tools and the complexity of the target websites/documents.
